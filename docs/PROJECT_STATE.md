## 2026-06-14 — Local Lenovo prototype restart

### Agent / tool
ChatGPT with Michael running local terminal commands on Lenovo Ubuntu laptop.

### Branch / ref
`main` at `b5f84f1` — `Add Google Sign-In to administrator login`

### Current confirmed local state
- Repository exists locally at `/home/michael-chambers/CAOSCARE.COM`.
- `AGENTS.md` exists.
- `docs/BUILD_STATUS.md` exists.
- `docs/REPO_MAP.md` exists.
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT_RUNBOOK.md` exists.
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md` did not exist before this entry.
- Laptop has `git`, `python3`, `node`, `npm`, `claude`, `rtl_433`, and `rtl_test`.
- Laptop does not currently have `docker`, `yarn`, or `codex`.
- SDR tooling is already installed, so Nooelec/pendant testing can be handled later without starting from zero.

### What changed
- Created `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md` as the living continuation/status file.
- Standardized the agent workflow: humans and agents only need to remember `AGENTS.md`; `AGENTS.md` points to the project-state and repo-map files.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` read order so future agents read `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md` before continuing work.

### What is verified
- Local repo is present.
- Documentation structure is present.
- Project state file is now established.

### Blocked / not yet done
- Local backend/frontend have not been started yet.
- MongoDB is not verified locally.
- Frontend package install is not verified locally.
- Wi-Fi A/C control is not connected yet.
- Claude-generated bridge/auth files are not currently located in the repo.
- No hardware test has been run in this session.

### Next safe step
Review and commit the documentation operating-procedure update, then continue with local Lenovo prototype setup.

## 2026-06-14 — Local MongoDB installed for Lenovo prototype

### Agent / tool
Claude Code with Michael running local sudo install commands on the Lenovo Ubuntu 24.04 (noble) laptop. CAOSCare is local-first; the room node should keep working without internet, so a local MongoDB was chosen over MongoDB Atlas for the first prototype path.

### Branch / ref
`main` at `022d90e` — `Add project state operating procedure`

### What changed
- Attempted to add the official MongoDB 7.0 apt repository for Ubuntu 24.04 (noble); this failed because the 7.0 `noble` Release file was unavailable from the repository.
- Added the official MongoDB 8.0 apt repository for `noble`, which succeeded.
- Installed `mongodb-org` from the 8.0 repository successfully.
- Enabled and started the `mongod` systemd service.

### What is verified
- MongoDB reports version `v8.0.26`.
- The `mongod` service is active.
- Port `27017` is listening on `127.0.0.1`.
- The backend connection target should be `mongodb://localhost:27017`.

### Blocked / not yet done
- `backend/.env` has not been created yet (still only `backend/.env.example`).
- Python virtual environment for the backend has not been created.
- Backend requirements (`backend/requirements.txt`) are not installed.
- FastAPI backend has not been started; `/api/health` has not been validated against the new local MongoDB.
- Frontend install/build and Wi-Fi A/C control remain unaddressed (carried over from prior entries).

### Next safe step
Create `backend/.env` locally (set `MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017`, `DB_NAME`, and a strong local `JWT_SECRET`), create the Python virtual environment, install backend requirements, then start the FastAPI backend and verify `/api/health`.
